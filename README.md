## Features & Analysis
1. **Graphical and Tabular Data Representation**
   - Frequency distribution tables for **Age, Wages, and Education**.
   - Histograms for visualizing distribution.
   - Pie charts and bar charts for **gender distribution**.
   - Summary statistics for all variables.
   - Boxplots for understanding dispersion and outliers.

2. **Descriptive Statistical Measures**
   - Computation of **mean, variance, standard deviation, median, and IQR**.
   - Analysis of **Age, Wages, and Education**.
   - Gender mode identification.

3. **Probability Distributions**
   - Normal distribution applied to **Age**.
   - Calculation of **mean, variance, standard deviation, and expected value**.
   - Probability estimation for an individual of **Age = 35** using standardization.

4. **Regression Modeling & Predictions**
   - Scatter plots showcasing the relationships between **Wages & Education** and **Wages & Age**.
   - Multiple linear regression model: **Wages = a + b(Age) + c(Education) + e**.
   - Shiny app integration for real-time wage prediction based on user input.

5. **Confidence Intervals**
   - **95% confidence intervals** for descriptive measures.
   - Confidence intervals for **regression estimates**.
